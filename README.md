# LCD Temperature Controller 



## Goal

To build a temperature controller for my cheap chinese 40w CO2 laser cutter 

Parts required :-
 -  5v Arduino Nano ATMega328p (china clone)
 -  5v DS18B20 for water temperature sensor
 -  5v HD48870 20x4 character LCD display
 -  5v Buttons for menu
 - 12v fans induvidually via PWM (maybe upto 3)
 - 12v peltiers (PWM) (all in one, i have 4 working ATM, pictures soon) (aliex link here)
 - 12v water pump (PWM) (aliex link here)



## Reality
TBA  



## Realisation
I guessing I'm not the first to do all this, but it's my journey.  
This stuff takes time.  
Trying to figure out line breaks for github README.MD files.
